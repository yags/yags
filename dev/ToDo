---------- Done:
** Representations
     Add a representation of graphs using AdjacencyLists rather than AdjacencyMatrixes.

** BactrackBag now starts at [fail]

** Allow 'EmptyGraph' for degenerate cases in Links(<G>) et al.

** CopyCoordinates added. Standarized ways to do this.

** Fixed: RemoveEdges for SimpleGraphs was giving incorrect results.

** TimeInSeconds is faster now.  

** refurbish InfoClass/InfoLevel for YAGS. -

** Add GraphToGraph6 -

** Add DFSTree -

---------- Remains to be done (in this version):


---------- For next version:

** Add IsPlanar() -

** Re-Create YAGS's distribution list (usuarios???)

** Compatibility mode of YAGS to work with GRAPE, Digraphs, for resubmitting to GAP.
   (yagsDiameter, yagsOrder, yagsCliqueGraphs).

** Eficiency:
   Backtrack, Morphisms, Isomorphisms, RandomlyPermuted (from O(n^2) to O(n) ),
   AutomorphismGroup (Nauty?).

** Do Ismael's test files are usable for automatic test of manual?

** FIXME: What the heck is wrong with GAPDOC 1.6.1, ExtractExampes(), doc/testexamples.gap

** FIXME: warnings during manual production???

** FIXME: Use better filenames for doc/testexamples.gap and doc/docsettings.gap

** FIXME: Makefile in webpage is not working: wget and some copies did not work(!)

** FIXME: Relaunch crontab job (make) once the above is solved.

** Add a non-blocking version of Draw.

** Extend Girth for other categories (with arrows).

** Automatize cleanning files and dumping Trash by means of a Makefile.

** Make GroupGraph() more simmilar to Graph in GRAPE.

** Use temporal files for Draw(G) (instead of "drawgraph.raw").

** Allow holes in the lists of GraphByWalks (i.e. ClawGraph(3)=GraphByWalks([1,[2,,3,,4]]); ) 

** "partial solution", "feasible solution", "partial morphism" are used inconsistently.
   Also they are defined as prefixes of solutions/morphisms and that is not exactly true.

** "arrow", "edge" and "loop" are used inconsistently. Many times edge is used as a
    synonym of the others.

** Add RandomGraph(n,k) where k is the number of edges.

** Include some 'test files' in directory YAGS-DIR/tst?

** Add drawings of graphs/ASCII-art for graph examples, specially in
   families.gd, alltopic.xml (families section).

**  Draw()
    make it faster/
            save figure files
                    
** Fix all 'FIXME' tags.

** Do operators defined in operators.g work?

** digraphs
    DichromaticNumber, InconexionAciclica, etc.
       
** clasics
    ChromaticNumber, IsPlanarGraph, CrossingNumber, funciones para arboles, etc.
 
** morfismos
    GraphIsoRep, IsEmbeddable(G,H), IsMinor(G,H)

** classes
    IsCograph, IsBerge, IsPerfect, etc.

** ga
    evolve, cross, mute, poblsize, etc.

** cliques.g{d,i}
    RSCover, RRSCover, etc.
    IsCliqueDivergent
    CliqueBehavior

** Implement attribute 'Origin' or simmilar.

** Implement Automorphic Graphs
