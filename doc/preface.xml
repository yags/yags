    <P/>&YAGS; - <E>Yet Another Graph System</E> (also <E>Yttrium
    Aluminium GarnetS</E><Index>Yttrium Aluminium GarnetS</Index>) is
    a &GAP; package for dealing with graphs, in the sense of Graph
    Theory (not bar graphs, pie charts nor graphs of functions).  Our
    graphs are then, ordered pairs <M>G=(V,E)</M>, where <M>V</M> is a
    finite set of vertices and <M>E</M> is a finite set of edges which
    are (ordered or unordered) pairs of vertices.

    <P/>&YAGS; was initiated by M.A. Pizaña in May 2003, and later
    incorporated the work of R. MacKinney-Romero,
    R. Villarroel-Flores, C. Cedillo, I.A. Robles and D. López (in that order,
    see Section <Ref Sect="authors"/> for details). It sprang from our
    need of computing graphs and graph parameters within our research
    on graph theory and clique graphs. Consequently, &YAGS; is well
    suited for these purposes.

    <P/>&YAGS; is a &GAP; package and hence its code is interpreted
    and not compiled (although some compilation possibilities exist in
    &GAP;). Therefore, from the very beginning, it was clear that
    speed is not our main goal. Instead, we wanted a very functional,
    full-featured system; a system adequate for rapid prototyping of
    algorithms; and a quick, easy-to-use, way for testing the rapidly
    changing working conjectures that are typical of the research
    process.

    <P/>Over the years, &YAGS; grew to its present size of more than
    200 methods and more than 10 thousands lines of code. We considered
    that all this code and effort could (and should) be useful for
    other people and then we decided to engage in the task of tying
    up loose ends and writing this manual.

    <P/>We would like to mention that we started using
    <Package>GRAPE</Package>, and we are grateful to its author,
    Leonard H. Soicher, for the very useful system that we used for
    several years.  But at some point we needed some Object-Oriented
    features that were not easy to implement in
    <Package>GRAPE</Package> and our own subsystem had to follow its
    own way.  If the reader has a profound need for having groups
    acting on her/his graphs, then <Package>GRAPE</Package> may be the
    best choice. On the other hand, &YAGS; offers a much wider set of
    functions (Appendix <Ref Appendix="allalpha"/>); a graph-drawing
    subsystem (<Ref Func="Draw"/>); many methods for dealing with
    graph homomorphism (Chapter <Ref Chap="morphismsofgraphs"/>); an
    Object-Oriented approach that simplifies the task of working with
    several different graph categories (Chapter <Ref
    Chap="graphcategories"/>); and a generic backtracking subsystem
    useful to solve many combinatorial problems easily (Chapter <Ref
    Chap="backtracking"/>).
