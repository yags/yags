  [33X[0;0YBacktracking  is  an  algorithmic  technique  for searching in combinatorial
  spaces: For instance, when you need to find a particular function (morphism,
  coloring,  etc)  subject  to  some  criterion ([13Xiso[113Xmorphism, [13Xproper[113X coloring,
  etc).[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIn  this  chapter  we  describe the technique and the facilities provided by
  [5XYAGS[105X  to  aid  in  the  rapid  prototyping  of backtracking algorithms. This
  chapter  is  written for the non-expert programmer, which is who can benefit
  the most from these facilities.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YWhile  the  expert programmers will not have any problem designing their own
  backtracking  algorithms,  they  can  still benefit from [5XYAGS[105X's backtracking
  facilities  since  it  may  still  be  faster  to implement/test/prototype a
  backtracking  algorithm  using  [5XYAGS[105X's  facilities.  We recommend the expert
  programmer  to  go directly to [2XBacktrack[102X ([14XB.1-9[114X) where a minimal non-trivial
  example (for computing derangements) is shown.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe kind of combinatorial problems that can be addressed by backtracking are
  those  that  can  be  represented by a decision tree: those where we have to
  make  a  succession  of  choices  to find a solution. These include problems
  where  we  want to find: morphisms, isomorphisms, cages, colorings, cliques,
  Hamiltonian   cycles,   walks,   paths,   subgraphs,  and  much  much  more.
  Combinatorial  problems that can be represented by a decision tree are truly
  everywhere.  [5XYAGS[105X  backtracking  facilities  are  provided  by  means of the
  operations               [10XBacktrackBag(Opts,Chk,Done,Extra)[110X               and
  [10XBacktrack(L,Opts,Chk,Done,Extra)[110X.[133X

  [33X[0;0YAs  a  concrete  example consider graph colorings: You have a set of colors,
  say [10X["red", "blue"][110X and a graph, say [10Xg:=PathGraph(3)[110X, whose vertices are [10X[1,
  2,  3][110X.  Then  a coloring is a function [22Xf: {1, 2, 3} → {red, blue}[122X, which in
  [5XYAGS[105X  would  be  represented  by  a  List  [10XL:=[ f(1), f(2), f(3)][110X. There are
  (obviously)   eight  of  such  colorings,  which  are  easy  to  list  using

  [33X[0;0YIn  the  previous  example,  only  two parameters of [10XBacktrackBag[110X are really
  used,  namely:  [10XOpts[110X  (which stands for [13Xoptions[113X) and [10XDone[110X; when used in this
  way,  [10XOpts[110X  is simply the codomain of the sought function and [10XDone[110X is simply
  the  size  of  the domain. When working with graph colorings it is common to
  use  numbers instead of actual colors or color names, so we could also write
  even more compactly:[133X

  stores  the solution within [10XL[110X, so that [10XL[110X can be used as a starting point for
  the  search  of  the  next  solution.  Usually,  [10XL:=[][110X is used for the first
  search.  When Calling [10XBacktrack(L,Opts,Chk,Done,Extra)[110X, [10XL[110X may also contain a
  [13Xpartial[113X solution (i.e. a prefix of a solution like [10XL:=[ 1 ][110X or [10XL:=[ 1, 0 ][110X),
  however  it  will  trust  the  user  on this and it will not check that [10XL[110X is
  indeed a partial solution.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0Y[10XBacktrack[110X  returns  [10Xfail[110X  when  no  more  solutions  are  available, but for
  technical  reasons,  [10XL[110X  must  always  be a list, so [10XL:=[ fail ][110X is the final
  value of [10XL[110X.[133X

  [10XExtra[110X  have  not  been  explained.  Both  issues  are  addressed in the next
  section.[133X

  [33X[0;0YIn graph theory we are usually more interested in [13Xproper colorings[113X than just
  in  colorings.  A  proper  coloring  is  a coloring in which no two adjacent
  vertices  have the same color. We can easily accommodate the new requirement
  within  our  backtracking  operations.  We are going to use [10XChk[110X to check the
  fulfillment of the condition at each step in the construction of a solution.
  Moreover,  in  order  to check the new condition we certainly need the extra
  information  contained  in the graph we are coloring. This extra information
  (the graph) is passed in the [10XExtra[110X parameter.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YMore  generally, [10XChk[110X is a user-provided function [10XChk(L,Extra)[110X which receives
  a  partial  solution  [10XL[110X  and  some extra information [10XExtra[110X; it returns [10Xfalse[110X
  whenever  it  knows  that  [10XL[110X  can not be completed to a full solution and it
  returns   [10Xtrue[110X   otherwise.  Note  then  that  our  backtracking  operations
  internally  call  [10XChk[110X  several times during the process of constructing each
  solution:  once  each time [10XL[110X grows in length. In each call to [10XChk[110X it is safe
  to  assume  that  all  proper  prefixes  of [10XL[110X have already been verified and
  approved by [10XChk[110X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIn  our  example,  [10XL[110X  contains  the color choices already made for the first
  vertices:  [10X1,  2,  ... Length(L)[110X. It is safe to assume that all but the last
  choice  are  already checked to satisfy the properness requirement. The last
  color  choice  so  far  is then the one in [10XL[Length(L)][110X and we have to check
  (within  [10XChk[110X)  if  it  also satisfy the properness requirement. We can do it
  like this:[133X

  [33X[0;0YNow  we get only two solutions, as expected. We emphasize here the fact that

  Therefore  (for  instance)  at  some  point the partial solution [10X[ 0, 0 ][110X is
  tried  and  since it is found unfeasible by [10XChk[110X is is discarded and no other
  partial  solution  with  that  prefix  is  ever  tried.  This  produces huge
  reductions  in  execution  time  as  compared  to  the  (naive)  approach of
  computing  all  the  colorings first and then filtering out those which does
  not  satisfy the properness requirement. In particular we can compute proper

  In  our  previous  examples  [10XOpts[110X  was  always a list and [10XDone[110X was always an
  integer. Both can also be functions.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YWhen  [10XOpts[110X  is  a  function, it receives [10XL[110X and [10XExtra[110X, and then [10XOpts(L,Extra)[110X
  should return the list of options available to extend the partial solution [10XL[110X
  at  that  particular stage. This way the list of options can be different at
  different  times which is useful for instance when the union of all possible
  options is too big or even unbounded.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YWhen   [10XDone[110X  is  a  function,  it  also  receives  [10XL[110X  and  [10XExtra[110X,  and  then
  [10XDone(L,Extra)[110X  returns  [10Xtrue[110X  whenever  [10XL[110X  is a full solution and it returns
  [10Xfalse[110X  otherwise.  This  is  useful when not all the solutions have the same
  length.  Thus  the  number  [10XN[110X  we  used  to  put  in  place  of the function
  [10XDone(L,Extra)[110X  is  equivalent to the function [10XDone:=function(L,Extra) return
  Length(L) >= N; end;[110X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YAlso,  when  a  number  [10XN[110X  is used in place of [10XDone[110X, an implicit upper bound
  [10XLength(L)<= N[110X is added internally to [10XChk[110X, so it is [13Ximperative[113X to add such an
  explicit  bound  to  [10XChk[110X  when  a  function  is  used for [10XDone[110X otherwise the
  backtracking  algorithm will try to find longer and longer solutions without
  bound or end until the memory of the computer is exhausted.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YAs an example, assume we want to find all the walks on 5-cycle that start at
  vertex  1  and  end  at vertex 2 with length at most 4 (at most 5 vertices).
  Then we can proceed as follows:[133X

  supported  by  [5XGAP[105X;  indeed  [5XYAGS[105X  only  uses  it to pass information to the

  if  you need pass more than one extra parameter, say two graphs [10Xg[110X and [10Xh[110X, you
  just   put  them  in  a  list  (or  record,  etc)  and  pass  the  parameter

  [33X[0;0YSooner  or  later you will need to debug a bactracking algorithm that is not
  working  as expected, or at least, you would like to know how much work your
