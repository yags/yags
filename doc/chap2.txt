  [1X2.1 [33X[0;0YWhat is [5XYAGS[105X[101X[1X?[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0Y[5XYAGS[105X  -  [13XYet  Another Graph System[113X (also [13XYttrium Aluminium GarnetS[113X) is a [5XGAP[105X
  package  for  dealing  with  graphs,  in  the sense of Graph Theory (not bar
  graphs,  pie  charts  nor graphs of functions). Hence our graphs are ordered
  pairs  [22XG=(V,E)[122X, where [22XV[122X is a finite set of vertices and [22XE[122X is a finite set of
  edges which are (ordered or unordered) pairs of vertices.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0Y[5XYAGS[105X  was  designed  to  be  useful for research on graphs theory and clique
  graphs. It is a very functional, full-featured system; a system adequate for
  rapid  prototyping  of  algorithms;  and it is a quick, easy-to-use way, for
  testing  the  rapidly  changing working conjectures which are typical of the
  research process.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0Y[5XYAGS[105X  offers  an  ample  set  of  functions  (Appendix  [14XB[114X);  a graph-drawing
  subsystem  ([2XDraw[102X ([14XB.4-16[114X)); many methods for dealing with graph homomorphism
  (Chapter [14X5[114X); an Object-Oriented approach that simplifies the task of working
  with   several  different  graph  categories  (Chapter  [14X4[114X);  and  a  generic
  backtracking  subsystem  useful  to solve many combinatorial problems easily
  (Chapter [14X6[114X).[133X

        [33X[0;6YJava  runtime  environment  version  8  or  latter is required for the
        drawing  subsystem.  Most systems have Java already installed. You can
        verify  your current version of Java with the command: [11Xjava --version[111X,
        and  install  Java using: [11Xsudo apt install default-jre[111X on Debian-based

        [33X[0;6Y[5XGRAPE[105X  and  [5XYAGS[105X  are incompatible: they can not be loaded at the same
        time.   If   you   had   an   initialization  file  that  loads  [5XGRAPE[105X

  [1X2.3 [33X[0;0YA Gentle Tutorial[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YThis  tutorial assumes that you already installed [5XGAP[105X and [5XYAGS[105X; and that you
  have  some  basic  understanding of [5XGAP[105X: user interface, the read-eval-print
  loop,  arithmetic operations, and lists. It is strongly recommended that you
  have  some  [13Xworking  directory[113X,  [11XWORKING-DIR[111X,  different from your [5XGAP[105X's and
  [5XYAGS[105X's  installation  directories.  For  instance, if your home directory is
  [11X/home/joe/[111X  your working directory could be [11X/home/joe/Yags/[111X. Then you should
  open  a  terminal,  move to your working directory, start [5XGAP[105X and then, load

  [33X[0;0YThe  exact appearance of your system prompt ([11X/home/joe>[111X and [11X/home/joe/Yags/>[111X
  in  the example) may be different depending on your system, but the commands
  '[11Xcd Yags[111X' and '[11Xgap[111X' are actually the same in all supported systems (assuming
  your  working  directory  exists  and is named '[11XYags[111X'). From there (starting
  with  the  command '[11XLoadPackage("yags");[111X') everything happens within [5XGAP[105X and
  hence it is system-independent.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YNow  we  want  to  define  some  graph. Say we have the list of edges of the
  desired graph:[133X
  
  
  [24X[33X[0;6Y{ { 1, 2 }, { 2, 3 }, { 3, 4 }, { 4, 1 }, { 1, 5 }, { 5, 4 } }[133X[124X
  
  [33X[0;0YWe can put those edges in a list and then construct the graph:[133X
  
  [4X[32X  Example  [32X[104X
    [4X[25Xgap>[125X [27Xlist:=[[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,1],[1,5],[5,4]];[127X[104X

    [4X[28X6, Adjacencies := [ [ 2, 4, 5 ], [ 1, 3 ], [ 2, 4 ], [ 1, 3, 5 ], [128X[104X
    [4X[28X  [ 1, 4 ] ] ) )[128X[104X
  [4X[32X[104X
  
  [33X[0;0YNote that [5XGAP[105X uses brackets ('[11X[[111X' and '[11X][111X') instead of braces ('[11X{[111X' and '[11X}[111X') to
  represent sets and lists (actually, in [5XGAP[105X a set is simply an ordered list).
  Note also that in [5XGAP[105X '[10Xlist[110X' and '[10XList[110X' are two different things and you can
  not  use  the  latter  since it is a reserved word of [5XGAP[105X. In general, it is
  better  for  you  to  use  lowercase names for your variables, to avoid name
  clashes, since all functions in [5XGAP[105X and [5XYAGS[105X start with an uppercase letter.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  result  in  the  previous example says that it is a graph, and a [13Xsimple
  graph[113X.  By  default  all  graphs in [5XYAGS[105X are simple (no loops, no arrows, no
  parallel edges, only plain undirected edges), in Chapter [14X4[114X we explain how to
  work  with other types of graphs, like digraphs, loopless graphs, and graphs
  that may have loops (but no parallel edges are supported in [5XYAGS[105X at all). In
  this gentle tutorial all our graphs are simple.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  result also says, that the just constructed graph [10Xg[110X have [10X5[110X vertices and
  [10X6[110X  edges.  The  reported  list  of  adjacencies  means  that the vertex [10X1[110X is
  adjacent (connected by an edge) to [10X2[110X, [10X4[110X and [10X5[110X, that the vertex [10X2[110X is adjacent
  to  [10X1[110X  and [10X3[110X and so on. To be sure, we can draw our graph and check if it is
  the intended graph:[133X
  
  [4X[32X  Example  [32X[104X
    [4X[25Xgap>[125X [27XDraw(g);[127X[104X
  [4X[32X[104X
  
  [33X[0;0YA  separate  window  appears  with an editable drawing of the graph (but the
  graph  itself  is  not  editable  here).  On  that window, type: '[10XD[110X' (toggle
  dynamics  on/off), '[10XR[110X' (toggle repulsion on/off), '[10XL[110X' (toggle labels on/off)
  and '[10XF[110X' (fit graph into window) to obtain a nice drawing (the initial one is
  random). The full list of keyboard commands for the [10XDraw[110X window is displayed
  when  typing '[10XH[110X' (toggle help message). Besides these keyboard commands, you
  can use your mouse in obvious ways to edit the drawing.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YTo  quit,  type '[10XS[110X'. The drawing is stored within the graph [10Xg[110X and remembered
  by [5XYAGS[105X in case you want to draw the graph again.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIf you are new to [5XGAP[105X, it may be worth mentioning that you need not remember
  or  type  all  the  full names of every [5XYAGS[105X operation: [5XGAP[105X supports command
  completion.  For  instance, if you type [11XPath[111X and then hit the [11X<TAB>[111X key, [5XGAP[105X
  automatically  completes the prefix to the unique command that completes it,
  namely:  [11XPathGraph[111X.  If,  on the other hand, the prefix has several possible
  completions,  then  [5XGAP[105X  simply  beeps, but a second [11X<TAB>[111X makes [5XGAP[105X respond
  with  a  list  of possible completions, so you can then type some additional
  keys and perhaps type [11X<TAB>[111X again, and so on.[133X

  [33X[0;0YNote  that  the graph [10Xg[110X remains the same, but the graph [10Xh[110X has two additional
  edges. This is done in this way, because in [5XYAGS[105X everything that is computed
  about  a  graph is stored within the graph, so that we never need to compute
  something  twice.  This  saves  time  when  computing  attributes  of graphs
  requiring  CPU-intensive  algorithms  (like  computing  cliques  and  clique
  graphs),  but  at  the expense of having to make a copy of the graph when we
