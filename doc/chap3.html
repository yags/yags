<h3>3 <span class="Heading">Cliques and Clique Graphs</span></h3>

<p>A <em>clique</em> is a maximal complete subgraph (other texts use <em>maxclique</em> for this concept). It is common to identify induced subgraphs of a graph with their vertex sets; accordingly, a clique in <strong class="pkg">YAGS</strong> is actually a set of vertices of a graph such that any two vertices in the clique are adjacent in the considered graph.</p>

<p>The <em>clique graph</em>, <span class="SimpleMath">K(G)</span>, of a graph <span class="SimpleMath">G</span> is the intersection graph of all the cliques of <span class="SimpleMath">G</span>: Each clique of <span class="SimpleMath">G</span> is a vertex of <span class="SimpleMath">K(G)</span>, two of them are adjacent in <span class="SimpleMath">K(G)</span> if and only if they have a non-empty intersection.</p>

<p>A number of <strong class="pkg">YAGS</strong>'s features concerning cliques and clique graphs are described in this chapter.</p>

<p><a id="X786467B78756F151" name="X786467B78756F151"></a></p>

<h4>3.1 <span class="Heading">Cliques and Clique Number</span></h4>

<p>You can get the set of all the cliques of a graph by means of <code class="func">Cliques</code> (<a href="chapB.html#X7AA94AAB7961CEC0"><span class="RefLink">B.3-7</span></a>); if you want to know the completes of given order (maximal or not) you may use <code class="func">CompletesOfGivenOrder</code> (<a href="chapB.html#X7C0053187FFA2F57"><span class="RefLink">B.3-14</span></a>) instead.</p>


<div class="example"><pre>
<span class="GAPprompt">gap&gt;</span> <span class="GAPinput">g:=SunGraph(4);;</span>
<span class="GAPprompt">gap&gt;</span> <span class="GAPinput">Cliques(g);</span>
[ [ 2, 4, 6, 8 ], [ 2, 3, 4 ], [ 1, 2, 8 ], [ 4, 5, 6 ], [ 6, 7, 8 ] ]
<span class="GAPprompt">gap&gt;</span> <span class="GAPinput">CompletesOfGivenOrder(g,3);</span>
[ [ 1, 2, 8 ], [ 2, 3, 4 ], [ 2, 4, 6 ], [ 2, 4, 8 ], [ 2, 6, 8 ], 
  [ 4, 5, 6 ], [ 4, 6, 8 ], [ 6, 7, 8 ] ]
<span class="GAPprompt">gap&gt;</span> <span class="GAPinput">CompletesOfGivenOrder(g,4);</span>
[ [ 2, 4, 6, 8 ] ]
</pre></div>

<p>Note that <code class="code">CompletesOfGivenOrder</code> uses a simple, straightforward backtracking algorithm, whereas <code class="code">Cliques</code> uses the Bron-Kerbosch algorithm <a href="chapBib.html#biBBK73">[4]</a> which in our experience is the best algorithm for finding all cliques of a graph in practice. In particular, <code class="code">Cliques</code> is much faster than <code class="code">CompletesOfGivenOrder</code> (when comparable).</p>

<p>In <strong class="pkg">YAGS</strong> all graphs are <em>immutable</em>, that is, once created, all graphs always remain exactly the same graph. If you need to modify a graph, you actually construct a new graph by copying the first graph and (for example) adding or deleting some edges (all of this in a single atomic step) therefore creating a new immutable graph. All graph-modifying operations in <strong class="pkg">YAGS</strong> (e.g. <code class="code">AddEdges</code>, <code class="code">RemoveEdges</code>, etc.) work in this way. This is time-consuming if your work involves many frequent graph editions. On the other hand, this design decision allows us to meaningfully store all computed graph attributes within the graph itself: Since the graph is not going to change ever, it will always have the same order, size, clique number, etc. <strong class="pkg">YAGS</strong> does exactly this with all graph attributes and properties. This means that no attribute is ever computed twice for the same graph and in particular it has a very clear effect on computing time:</p>


<div class="example"><pre>
<span class="GAPprompt">gap&gt;</span> <span class="GAPinput">g:=RandomGraph(200);;                  </span>
<span class="GAPprompt">gap&gt;</span> <span class="GAPinput">Cliques(g);;time;    </span>
5784
<span class="GAPprompt">gap&gt;</span> <span class="GAPinput">Cliques(g);;time;    </span>
0
</pre></div>

<p>The <em>clique number</em>, <span class="SimpleMath">ω(G)</span>, is the order of a maximum clique (all cliques are maximal, but they may be of several different orders). On the other hand, the <em>number of cliques</em>, is simply the cardinality of the set of all cliques.</p>


<div class="example"><pre>
<span class="GAPprompt">gap&gt;</span> <span class="GAPinput">g:=SunGraph(4);;</span>
<span class="GAPprompt">gap&gt;</span> <span class="GAPinput">CliqueNumber(g);</span>
4
<span class="GAPprompt">gap&gt;</span> <span class="GAPinput">NumberOfCliques(g);</span>
5
</pre></div>

<p>For random graphs with edge probability <span class="SimpleMath">p</span> and taking <span class="SimpleMath">b:=1/p</span>, it is known <a href="chapBib.html#biBBol01">[2]</a> that the distribution of the clique number has a very concentrated peak around <span class="Math">2\log_{b}n-2\log_{b}\log_{b}n +2\log_{b}(\frac{e}{2})</span>:</p>

<h4>3.2 <span class="Heading">Clique Graphs</span></h4>

<p>Whenever we have a graph <span class="SimpleMath">G</span>, we can compute its clique graph <span class="SimpleMath">K(G)</span>, which is the intersection graph of the cliques of <span class="SimpleMath">G</span>. Much work has been done on clique graphs <a href="chapBib.html#biBSzw03">[29]</a><a href="chapBib.html#biBPri95b">[24]</a><a href="chapBib.html#biBLPV14">[20]</a> and they have even been applied to Loop Quantum Gravity <a href="chapBib.html#biBReq00a">[26]</a><a href="chapBib.html#biBReq00b">[25]</a><a href="chapBib.html#biBReq03">[27]</a>. It is know that deciding whether a given graph is a clique graph (<span class="SimpleMath">G≅ K(H)</span> for some <span class="SimpleMath">H</span>) is NP-complete <a href="chapBib.html#biBAFFG09">[1]</a>.</p>

<p>Computing the clique graph of a graph is clearly an exponential time operation in the worst case as the maximum number of cliques of a graph of order <span class="SimpleMath">n</span> is <span class="Math">\alpha\times 3^{\frac{n-\alpha}{3}}= \Theta(3^{\frac{n}{3}})</span> <a href="chapBib.html#biBMM65">[21]</a> (here <span class="SimpleMath">α</span> it taken such that <span class="SimpleMath">α ∈ {2,3,4}</span> and <span class="SimpleMath">n≡ α</span> mod 3). However, very often the number of cliques in a graph is much smaller; the following experiment shows that the number of cliques of a graph on 50 vertices is likely between 700 and 1300 instead of the maximum possible which is <span class="SimpleMath">2×3^16=86093442</span>.</p>

<p>Therefore, we can often compute cliques and clique graphs <em>in practice</em>, despite the worst case exponential time. Also, <code class="code">CliqueGraph</code> is an attribute of graphs (as most operations in <strong class="pkg">YAGS</strong>) and hence, the result is stored within the graph in order to prevent unnecessary recalculation:</p>


<div class="example"><pre>
<span class="GAPprompt">gap&gt;</span> <span class="GAPinput">g:=RandomGraph(80);;     </span>
<span class="GAPprompt">gap&gt;</span> <span class="GAPinput">kg:=CliqueGraph(g);;time;</span>
26499
<span class="GAPprompt">gap&gt;</span> <span class="GAPinput">kg2:=CliqueGraph(g);;time;</span>
0
<span class="GAPprompt">gap&gt;</span> <span class="GAPinput">kg2=kg;</span>
true
</pre></div>

<p>Note that the last line in the previous example is <em>not</em> testing for isomorphism, it only tests whether both adjacency matrices are equal. It remains possible, however, that the graph at hand is one of those with a huge number of cliques. We can limit the maximum number of cliques to be computed in <code class="code">Cliques</code> and <code class="code">CliqueGraph</code> using the optional extra parameter <var class="Arg">maxNumCli</var>: With this extra parameter, the computation is aborted when the number of computed cliques reaches <var class="Arg">maxNumCli</var>.</p>


<div class="example"><pre>
<span class="GAPprompt">gap&gt;</span> <span class="GAPinput">g:=OctahedralGraph(3);; </span>
<span class="GAPprompt">gap&gt;</span> <span class="GAPinput">CliqueGraph(g,1000); </span>
Graph( rec( Category := SimpleGraphs, Order := 8, Size := 
24, Adjacencies := [ [ 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 ], [ 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8 ], 
  [ 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8 ], [ 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8 ], [ 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8 ], 
  [ 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8 ], [ 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8 ], [ 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 ] 
 ] ) )
<span class="GAPprompt">gap&gt;</span> <span class="GAPinput">g:=OctahedralGraph(30);; #this has 2^30=1073741824 cliques.</span>
<span class="GAPprompt">gap&gt;</span> <span class="GAPinput">CliqueGraph(g,1000);                            </span>
fail
</pre></div>

<p>Alternatively we can use the <code class="code">InfoLevel</code> mechanism (<a href="chapB.html#X8602312E8239A2C0"><span class="RefLink">B.24-3</span></a>) to be informed about the progress of clique-related operations in <strong class="pkg">YAGS</strong>. This way we can abort the calculation (by typing <code class="code">Ctr-C</code>) in case we see that it will take eons to finish.</p>

<p>In <strong class="pkg">YAGS</strong> the vertices of a graph are always <code class="code">[1, 2, ..., Order(G)]</code>, but often they also have some <em>names</em>. This names depend on the way in which the graph is constructed and reflect the origin of the graph. We can get the names of the vertices by using <code class="func">VertexNames</code> (<a href="chapB.html#X86050933823255F1"><span class="RefLink">B.22-3</span></a>). In the case of clique graphs, the vertex names are the corresponding cliques of the original graph.</p>


<div class="example"><pre>
<span class="GAPprompt">gap&gt;</span> <span class="GAPinput">g:=SunGraph(4);          </span>
Graph( rec( Category := SimpleGraphs, Order := 8, Size := 
14, Adjacencies := [ [ 2, 8 ], [ 1, 3, 4, 6, 8 ], [ 2, 4 ], 
  [ 2, 3, 5, 6, 8 ], [ 4, 6 ], [ 2, 4, 5, 7, 8 ], [ 6, 8 ], 
  [ 1, 2, 4, 6, 7 ] ] ) )
<span class="GAPprompt">gap&gt;</span> <span class="GAPinput">kg:=CliqueGraph(g);</span>
Graph( rec( Category := SimpleGraphs, Order := 5, Size := 
8, Adjacencies := [ [ 2, 3, 4, 5 ], [ 1, 3, 4 ], [ 1, 2, 5 ], 
  [ 1, 2, 5 ], [ 1, 3, 4 ] ] ) )
<span class="GAPprompt">gap&gt;</span> <span class="GAPinput">VertexNames(kg);</span>
[ [ 2, 4, 6, 8 ], [ 2, 3, 4 ], [ 1, 2, 8 ], [ 4, 5, 6 ], [ 6, 7, 8 ] ]
<span class="GAPprompt">gap&gt;</span> <span class="GAPinput">Cliques(g);</span>
[ [ 2, 4, 6, 8 ], [ 2, 3, 4 ], [ 1, 2, 8 ], [ 4, 5, 6 ], [ 6, 7, 8 ] ]
</pre></div>

<p>Hence, in the previous example, vertex 1 of <code class="code">kg</code> is (the one corresponding to) the clique <code class="code">[ 2, 4, 6, 8 ]</code> of <code class="code">g</code>, and vertex 2 is <code class="code">[ 2, 3, 4 ]</code> etc.</p>

<h4>3.3 <span class="Heading">Basements and Iterated Clique Graphs</span></h4>

<p>Iterated clique graphs are obtained by applying the clique operator several times. As before, we may wonder which vertices of <span class="SimpleMath">K^3(g)</span> constitute the clique corresponding to some vertex of <span class="SimpleMath">K^4(g)</span> and this can be settled using <code class="code">VertexNames</code> as explained in Section <a href="chap3.html#X7EC084CC84A85A76"><span class="RefLink">3.2</span></a>. But what if we want to know which vertices of <span class="SimpleMath">g</span> constitute some vertex of <span class="SimpleMath">K^4(g)</span>? This could be done using <code class="code">VertexNames</code> at level <span class="SimpleMath">K^4(g)</span> and then transforming each of the obtained vertices (in <span class="SimpleMath">K^3(g)</span>) using <code class="code">VertexNames</code> of <span class="SimpleMath">K^3(g)</span> and so on... but <strong class="pkg">YAGS</strong> already has an operation that does exactly that. The <em>basement</em> of a vertex <span class="SimpleMath">x</span> of an iterated clique graph <span class="SimpleMath">K^n(g)</span> with respect to some previous iterated clique graph <span class="SimpleMath">K^m(g)</span> (with <span class="SimpleMath">m≤ n</span>) is, roughly speaking, the set of vertices of <span class="SimpleMath">K^m(g)</span> that constitute the vertex <span class="SimpleMath">x</span>, that is, the set of vertices of <span class="SimpleMath">K^m(g)</span> which are needed for <span class="SimpleMath">x</span> to exist (see <code class="func">Basement</code> (<a href="chapB.html#X7F2566527F566D99"><span class="RefLink">B.2-3</span></a>) for a formal definition).</p>

<p>Basements where introduced (with a different name) in <a href="chapBib.html#biBBS95">[3]</a> and used again in <a href="chapBib.html#biBPiz04">[23]</a>. They have been useful to study distances and diameters on iterated clique graphs. They are also useful when dealing with stars and neckties.</p>

<h4>3.4 <span class="Heading">Stars and Neckties</span></h4>

<p>Stars and neckties are useful in understanding the structure of iterated clique graphs.</p>

<p>Let <span class="SimpleMath">G</span> be a graph and <span class="SimpleMath">x∈ G</span>. Let us define <span class="SimpleMath">x^*:={q∈ K(G) : x∈ q}</span>. We say that <span class="SimpleMath">x^*</span> is the <em>star</em> of <span class="SimpleMath">x</span>. Observe that <span class="SimpleMath">x^*</span> is (induces) a complete subgraph of <span class="SimpleMath">K(G)</span>, and may or may not be a clique of <span class="SimpleMath">K(G)</span> (i.e. a vertex of <span class="SimpleMath">K^2(G)</span>) depending on whether the star of <span class="SimpleMath">x</span> is a <em>maximal</em> complete subgraph or not.</p>

<p>On the other hand, a vertex in <span class="SimpleMath">K^2(G)</span> is of the form <span class="SimpleMath">Q:={q_1,q_2,...,q_r}</span> where each <span class="SimpleMath">q_i</span> is a clique of <span class="SimpleMath">G</span> (i.e. a vertex of <span class="SimpleMath">K(G)</span>). We say that such <em>clique of cliques</em> <span class="SimpleMath">Q</span> is <em>a star</em> if there is some vertex <span class="SimpleMath">x∈ G</span> such that <span class="SimpleMath">x∈ q_i</span> for all <span class="SimpleMath">q_i∈ Q</span>; equivalently <span class="SimpleMath">Q</span> is a star if the total intersection of its cliques is non-empty (i.e. <span class="SimpleMath">∩ Q ≠ ∅</span>). When <span class="SimpleMath">Q</span> is not a star (i.e. when <span class="SimpleMath">∩ Q = ∅</span>), we say it is a <em>necktie</em>. It is easy to show that a clique of cliques <span class="SimpleMath">Q</span> is a star if and only if its basement at <span class="SimpleMath">G</span> is exactly the closed neighborhood of a vertex <span class="SimpleMath">N[x]</span>.</p>

<p>Clearly, a star is also the star of some vertex and any star of a vertex which is a clique of cliques is a star. On the other hand, if the star of a vertex <span class="SimpleMath">x^*</span> is not a clique of cliques, it is surely contained in some clique of cliques <span class="SimpleMath">Q∈ K^2(G)</span>. If for each vertex <span class="SimpleMath">x</span> we pick such a fixed clique of cliques <span class="SimpleMath">*(x):=Q∈ K^2(G)</span> with <span class="SimpleMath">x^*⊆ Q</span>, we get the star morphism <span class="SimpleMath">*:G→ K^2(G)</span>.</p>

<p>A very remarkable feature of the second iterated clique graph <span class="SimpleMath">K^2(G)</span> of <span class="SimpleMath">G</span> is that the star morphism is often injective and even an isomorphism onto its image.</p>

<p>Hence <span class="SimpleMath">K^2(G)</span> is the union of two subgraphs (with some extra edges between them): One composed entirely of stars and the other composed entirely of neckties. The one composed entirely of stars is very similar to <span class="SimpleMath">G</span> and often even isomorphic to <span class="SimpleMath">G</span>.</p>

<p>A graph is <em>clique-Helly</em> when every family of pairwise intersecting cliques has a non-empty total intersection. Evidently, if <span class="SimpleMath">G</span> is clique-Helly, then every vertex of <span class="SimpleMath">K^2(G)</span> is a star. Escalante <a href="chapBib.html#biBEsc73">[6]</a> showed that in the clique-Helly case, <span class="SimpleMath">K^2(G)</span> is isomorphic to a subgraph of <span class="SimpleMath">G</span>, namely, the <code class="func">ParedGraph</code> (<a href="chapB.html#X7C3B877A84E18B53"><span class="RefLink">B.16-4</span></a>) of <span class="SimpleMath">G</span> (which just removes dominated vertices) and hence the star morphism in the clique-Helly case is an isomorphism exactly when <span class="SimpleMath">G</span> does not have dominated vertices.</p>

<h4>3.5 <span class="Heading">Clique Behavior</span></h4>

<p>When we have a graph <span class="SimpleMath">G</span> and its iterated clique graphs <span class="SimpleMath">K(G), K^2(G), K^3(G), ...</span> a natural question is: Are all the graphs in the sequence non-isomorphic to each other? The answer is "no" if and only if <span class="SimpleMath">K^n(G)≅ K^m(G)</span> for some <span class="SimpleMath">n≠ m</span> if and only if there is a finite bound for the sequence of orders of the iterated clique graphs <span class="SimpleMath">|K^n(G)|</span>. When this happens, we say that <span class="SimpleMath">G</span> is <em>clique convergent</em> and otherwise, we say that it is <em>clique divergent</em>. To determine the <em>clique behavior</em> of a graph consist in deciding whether it is clique convergent or clique divergent. It is an open problem whether the clique behavior is algorithmically decidable or not <a href="chapBib.html#biBLNP04">[15]</a> and Meidanis even asked if the clique operator has the computing power needed to simulate any Turing Machine, see <span class="URL"><a href="http://www.ic.unicamp.br/~meidanis/research/clique/">http://www.ic.unicamp.br/~meidanis/research/clique/</a></span> (fetched in 2001), but that does not prevent us from trying to determine clique behavior for specific graphs.</p>

<p>The first thing to try when determining the clique behavior of a graph is simply to iterate the clique operator on it and check for the orders, if we see the order stabilizes, we have a candidate where we can check for isomorphism.</p>


<div class="example"><pre>                                    
<span class="GAPprompt">gap&gt;</span> <span class="GAPinput">g:=TimesProduct(Icosahedron,CompleteGraph(3));;Order(g);</span>
36
<span class="GAPprompt">gap&gt;</span> <span class="GAPinput">g1:=K(g);;Order(g1);                                    </span>
120
<span class="GAPprompt">gap&gt;</span> <span class="GAPinput">g2:=K(g1);;Order(g2);                                   </span>
156
<span class="GAPprompt">gap&gt;</span> <span class="GAPinput">g3:=K(g2);;Order(g3);</span>
120
<span class="GAPprompt">gap&gt;</span> <span class="GAPinput">IsIsomorphicGraph(g1,g3);                               </span>
true
</pre></div>

<p>Often however, the orders just keep growing. But then the second thing to try (or even the first!) is to take the <code class="func">CompletelyParedGraph</code> (<a href="chapB.html#X7839FF457E264FE1"><span class="RefLink">B.3-12</span></a>) of <span class="SimpleMath">G</span> since it is known that the clique behavior is invariant under removal of dominated vertices <a href="chapBib.html#biBFNP04">[8]</a>. In the following example <code class="code">g</code> is clique convergent because <code class="code">h</code> is so, even if a direct calculation of the iterated clique graphs of <code class="code">g</code> just ends in memory overflow.</p>


<div class="example"><pre>
<span class="GAPprompt">gap&gt;</span> <span class="GAPinput">cp7:=ComplementGraph(PathGraph(7));;       </span>
<span class="GAPprompt">gap&gt;</span> <span class="GAPinput">g:=ComplementGraph(TimesProduct(cp7,cp7));;Order(g);</span>
49
<span class="GAPprompt">gap&gt;</span> <span class="GAPinput">g1:=K(g);;Order(g1);                                 </span>
204
<span class="GAPprompt">gap&gt;</span> <span class="GAPinput">g2:=K(g1);;Order(g2);</span>
7193
<span class="GAPprompt">gap&gt;</span> <span class="GAPinput">g3:=K(g2);;Order(g3);</span>
     --- user interrupt or recursion trap here ---
<span class="GAPbrkprompt">brk&gt;</span> <span class="GAPinput">quit;</span>
<span class="GAPprompt">gap&gt;</span> <span class="GAPinput">h:=CompletelyParedGraph(g);;Order(h); </span>
1
<span class="GAPprompt">gap&gt;</span> <span class="GAPinput">IsIsomorphicGraph(h,K(h)); </span>
true
</pre></div>

<p>It is even advisable construct the combined operator <span class="SimpleMath">PK</span> (compute the clique graph and then take the completely pared graph) and to compute the sequence of graphs under the iterated application of the <span class="SimpleMath">PK</span> operator: <span class="SimpleMath">(PK)^n(G)</span> is clique convergent (for any <span class="SimpleMath">n</span>) if and only if <span class="SimpleMath">G</span> is clique convergent.</p>


<div class="example"><pre>

<span class="GAPprompt">gap&gt;</span> <span class="GAPinput">#too many cliques to continue in this way.</span>
<span class="GAPprompt">gap&gt;</span> <span class="GAPinput">PK:=function(g) return CompletelyParedGraph(K(g)); end;</span>
function( g ) ... end
<span class="GAPprompt">gap&gt;</span> <span class="GAPinput">h1:=PK(g);;Order(h1);</span>
24
<span class="GAPprompt">gap&gt;</span> <span class="GAPinput">h2:=PK(h1);;Order(h2);</span>
25
<span class="GAPprompt">gap&gt;</span> <span class="GAPinput">h3:=PK(h2);;Order(h1);</span>

<span class="GAPprompt">gap&gt;</span> <span class="GAPinput">h3:=PK(h2);;Order(h3);</span>

<span class="GAPprompt">gap&gt;</span> <span class="GAPinput">h4:=PK(h3);;Order(h4);</span>

<span class="GAPprompt">gap&gt;</span> <span class="GAPinput">h5:=PK(h4);;Order(h5);</span>

<span class="GAPprompt">gap&gt;</span> <span class="GAPinput">IsIsomorphicGraph(h6,K(h6));</span>

</pre></div>

<p>If a graph is clique convergent, it must also be convergent under the <span class="SimpleMath">PK</span> operator; It is an open problem to determine whether the opposite is also true.</p>

<p>If <span class="SimpleMath">G</span> is clique convergent, then in principle we can determine that by computer (although there are sometimes insufficient memory or time) but that is not so for clique divergent graphs. Determining clique divergence for graphs can be quite challenging and there is even a graph on eight vertices (the <code class="code">SnubDisphenoid</code>) which seems to be divergent but nobody has a proof of it yet <a href="chapBib.html#biBLNP06">[17]</a>.</p>


<div class="example"><pre>
<span class="GAPprompt">gap&gt;</span> <span class="GAPinput">g:=SnubDisphenoid; </span>
Graph( rec( Category := SimpleGraphs, Order := 8, Size := 
18, Adjacencies := [ [ 2, 3, 4, 5, 8 ], [ 1, 3, 6, 7, 8 ], 
  [ 1, 2, 4, 6 ], [ 1, 3, 5, 6 ], [ 1, 4, 6, 7, 8 ], 
  [ 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 ], [ 2, 5, 6, 8 ], [ 1, 2, 5, 7 ] ] ) )
<span class="GAPprompt">gap&gt;</span> <span class="GAPinput">g1:=K(g);;Order(g1);</span>
12
<span class="GAPprompt">gap&gt;</span> <span class="GAPinput">g2:=K(g1);;Order(g2);</span>
20
<span class="GAPprompt">gap&gt;</span> <span class="GAPinput">g3:=K(g2);;Order(g3);</span>
56
<span class="GAPprompt">gap&gt;</span> <span class="GAPinput">g4:=K(g3);;Order(g4);</span>
1076
</pre></div>

<p>The fifth iterated clique graphs of the <code class="code">SnubDisphenoid</code> has at least <span class="SimpleMath">7.37× 10^9</span> vertices, but it is estimated that the number is more likely around <span class="SimpleMath">10^22</span>.</p>

<p>How to proceed then? Well there are many studied families of graphs whose clique behavior have been settled (including: the octahedral graphs, cographs, regular locally cyclic graphs (like the Icosahedron and the locally <span class="SimpleMath">C_6</span> graphs), some circulants, clockworkgraphs, some comparability graphs, locally colorable graphs) and some techniques that may be applicable (including: retractions, covering maps, expansivity, rank-divergence, dismantlings, local cutpoints).</p>

<p>Two of these techniques have been successful more often than others:</p>

<p>(1) If your graph <span class="SimpleMath">G</span> has a non-trivial automorphism <span class="SimpleMath">f:G→ G</span> that sends each vertex outside of its closed neighborhood (<span class="SimpleMath">f(x)not\in N[x]</span>), then there are chances that you can apply the rank-divergence techniques <a href="chapBib.html#biBLNP06">[17]</a><a href="chapBib.html#biBLNP09">[18]</a>.</p>

<p>(2) If your graph <span class="SimpleMath">G</span> is more like a random graph, then there are good chances that it has a retraction to a <span class="SimpleMath">d</span>-dimensional octahedron with at least 6 vertices, which implies the divergence of <span class="SimpleMath">G</span> <a href="chapBib.html#biBNeu78">[22]</a>. In our experience, a good way to look up for such a retraction is to find the cliques of <span class="SimpleMath">G</span> and then try to see if any of the cliques extends in <span class="SimpleMath">G</span> to an induced octahedral graph (<code class="func">OctahedralGraph</code> (<a href="chapB.html#X7B1FCFC979757FED"><span class="RefLink">B.15-1</span></a>)) of at least 6 vertices. The existence of an induced octahedral subgraph with one of its faces being a clique of <span class="SimpleMath">G</span> is sufficient to prove the existence of a retraction from <span class="SimpleMath">G</span> to the octahedral subgraph <a href="chapBib.html#biBKah09">[11]</a><a href="chapBib.html#biBLPV08b">[19]</a>.</p>

<p>We plan to incorporate soon an operation that applies the known techniques for clique divergence and convergence to a given graph in order to try to determine its clique behavior.</p>
