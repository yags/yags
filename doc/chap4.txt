  [33X[0;0YBy  default,  all  graphs  in [5XYAGS[105X are simple, i.e. all graphs belong to the
  [10XSimpleGraphs[110X  category. There are 5 graph categories in [5XYAGS[105X, namely: [2XGraphs[102X
  ([14XB.7-13[114X),  [2XUndirectedGraphs[102X  ([14XB.21-3[114X), [2XLooplessGraphs[102X ([14XB.12-4[114X), [2XSimpleGraphs[102X
  ([14XB.19-3[114X)  and [2XOrientedGraphs[102X ([14XB.15-5[114X). The inclusion relations among them is
  as follows:[133X
  
                  Graphs
                /        \    
  UndirectedGraphs      LooplessGraphs
                \        /          \       
               SimpleGraphs        OrientedGraphs
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  most general of these categories is [10XGraphs[110X: every graph in [5XYAGS[105X belongs
  to  some  category  and,  by  inclusion, every graph belongs to the category
  [10XGraphs[110X.  By definition a graph in [10XGraphs[110X may contain loops, arrows and edges
  (which  in [5XYAGS[105X are exactly the same as two opposite arrows); another way to
  say  it,  is  that  a  graph is anything that can be represented as a binary
  matrix   (its   adjacency   matrix).  In  particular,  no  multiple/parallel
  edges/arrows  are  allowed  in a graph in [5XYAGS[105X. Likewise, each of the [5XYAGS[105X's
  graph categories have their own characteristic properties:[133X
  
        [10XGraphs[110X             May contain loops, arrows and edges.                   
        [10XUndirectedGraphs[110X   Can not contain plain arrows (only edges and loops).   
        [10XLooplessGraphs[110X     Can not contain loops (only arrows and edges).         
        [10XSimpleGraphs[110X       Can not contain loops nor arrows (only edges).         
        [10XOrientedGraphs[110X     Can not contain edges nor loops (only arrows).         
  
  [33X[0;0YGraph  categories  simplify  things  for  users: for example in the category
  [10XSimpleGraphs[110X,  a  [13Xcomplete  graph[113X  may  be defined as a graph containing [21Xall
  possible  edges[121X among their vertices, but [21Xall possible edges[121X in the category
  [10XGraphs[110X includes the loops, while in the category [10XOrientedGraphs[110X, it can only
  contain one arrow for each pair of vertices.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  graph  category  used for constructing graphs forbids you to add a loop
  accidentally  or  to  forget to include one of the arrows that constitute an
  edge in a simple graph: Every graph created in [5XYAGS[105X is forced to comply with
  its graph category's characteristic properties.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0Y[5XYAGS[105X  supports several mechanisms to carefully control the graphs categories
  used  to  construct  your  graphs.  These  are  explained  in  the following
  sections.[133X
  
  
  [1X4.1 [33X[0;0YThe Default Graph Category[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  [10XDefaultGraphCategory[110X controls (in the absence of other indications) the
  graph  category  to  which  the  new  graphs  belong.  It can not be changed
  directly  as if it were a normal variable, instead, it can be changed by the
  method [2XSetDefaultGraphCategory[102X ([14XB.19-2[114X)[133X

  [33X[0;0YWhen  constructing a graph, [5XYAGS[105X always forces the new graphs to comply with
  its  category, hence, in the case of [10XOrientedGraphs[110X in the previous example,
  it  has  to  remove  one  of the arrows conforming the edge for each pair of
  vertices of the graph. Sometimes it may not be evident which arrow will [5XYAGS[105X

  [33X[0;0YTherefore,  if  you always work with [10XSimpleGraphs[110X, [5XYAGS[105X defaults are perfect
  for  you.  If,  in  the other hand you always work with [10XOrientedGraphs[110X (also
  known  as  [13Xdigraphs[113X),  you probably would want to start all your sessions by
  changing  the default graph category to that... or even better, you may want
  to create a startup file that does that automatically every time you start a
  [5XYAGS[105X session.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YOn  the  other  hand,  your work may involve graphs from more than one graph
  category.  In  such  a case, it is advisable to continue reading all of this
  chapter.[133X
  
  
  [1X4.2 [33X[0;0YThe Target Graph Category[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  default graph category is only part of the story. When constructing new
  graphs  from  existing ones, it may be natural to construct the new graph in
  the  least  common category that contains the original graphs, regardless of
  the [10XDefaultGraphCategory[110X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YFor  instance,  if  we  have graphs [10Xg[110X and [10Xh[110X that belong to the categories of
  [10XSimpleGraphs[110X  and  [10XOrientedGraphs[110X  (respectively), then a new graph which is
  the  [10XBoxTimesProduct[110X  (also  known  as  the  [13Xstrong product[113X) of them, should
  belong  to  the  least common category of both, namely to the [10XLooplessGraphs[110X
  category  (see  the  diagram  at the beginning of the chapter). This is what

  [33X[0;0YExactly  how  does  [5XYAGS[105X  decide  this?  Well,  with  very  few  and evident
  exceptions  (such as [2XOrientations[102X ([14XB.15-4[114X)), [5XYAGS[105X's functions that construct
  graphs,  always  calls internally the function [2XTargetGraphCategory[102X ([14XB.20-1[114X),
  and passes to it those of the original parameters which are graphs.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0Y[10XTargetGraphCategory[110X  returns  the  graph category indicated by [5XGAP[105X's [13Xoptions
  stack[113X  if  any  (see  the  next  section),  else it returns the least common
  category  containing  all of its parameters if any, or else (if it is called
